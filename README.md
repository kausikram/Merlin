### Quick Read me
Merlin is a very quick PHP framework. Designed for PHP 5/3 and Up.

Merlin is still work in progress and will probably be so for a little longer.

### What Merlin Will have

* An MVC ish System.
* A Decent Authentication and Permissions System.
* Pluggable Sub Apps System.

### What Merlin Will not have

* An ORM. There are a lot of brilliant ORMs written in php out there. you get to choose what yo are comfortable with.
* A Templating System, Again there are so many of them out there, why write one more and restrict developers.

### What Merlin truly is
Merlin hopes to do three things well:

* It hopes to have a brilliant url routing system.
* It hopes to have a brilliant input validation system.
* It hopes to be an extremely configurable system.

### Licenses
Merlin is released under a BSD license. You can play all you want. Feel free to contribute or buy me food.
